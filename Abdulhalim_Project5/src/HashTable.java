/**
 * 
 * This class was created in order for us to be able to store Node objects
 * (private class provided by professor) in a Hash Table format. Within this
 * class we also have the private Node class and the public NodeList class. Node
 * objects hold country name, population, covid cases info, as well as a
 * reference to the next Node in the list (Linked List). The HashTable object
 * holds an array of NodeList objects, which are linked lists of Node objects.
 * The HashTable constructor creates a HashTable object with said array being
 * size 293 (prime number approx. twice the size of the amount of Nodes we want
 * to store for this particular project. The HashTable class also has methods
 * for inserting Nodes, deleting Nodes, searching for a specific Node, printing
 * all Nodes, and printing the amount of empty and collided cells in the table.
